# Getting Started

The Parse platform provides a complete backend solution for your mobile application. Our goal is to totally eliminate the need for writing server code or maintaining servers.

If you're familiar with web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC we've taken many of the same principles and applied them to our platform. In particular, our SDK is ready to use out of the box with minimal configuration on your part.

If you haven't installed the SDK yet, please [head over to the QuickStart guide](/apps/quickstart#parse_data/unity/new) to get our SDK up and running in Unity3D. Note that our SDK requires Unity version 4.6.x and higher (including 5.x) and targets Android apps and iOS apps. You can also check out our [API Reference](/docs/dotnet/api) for more detailed information about our SDK.

Parse's Unity SDK makes heavy use of a subset of the [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873175.aspx) so that your apps remain responsive. For more information, please see the section on Tasks [below.](#tasks)
