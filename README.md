# Parse Docs

These are the markdown sources for all of the [platform guides](https://parse.com/docs) of Parse. The content for the guides is stored in this repo, and we use a [Background Job](https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#cloud-code-advanced-background-jobs) to process the markdown and store it in a Parse app. The guides you see on our website are simply served from this Parse app!

## How Do I Contribute?

If you have any fixes or suggestions, simply send us a pull request! The guides are organized first by language, then by platform. Take a look at our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Docs/wiki/Contributing-to-Docs) to learn more.

## Can I Access The Docs Offline?

This repository is public and all the files are in markdown. If you'd like to keep a copy locally, please do!
